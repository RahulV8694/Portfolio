          <p>I had the privilege of being mentored by Rahul during my time at Oracle Cerner, and I cannot recommend him enough. Rahul is not only exceptionally skilled in his work but also incredibly dedicated and passionate about what he does. His deep understanding of the subject matter, combined with his ability to explain complex concepts in a simple manner, made him an outstanding mentor.</p>
          <p>Rahul’s kindness and patience stood out as well. He was always approachable, willing to answer questions, and provided invaluable guidance throughout my journey.
